### Setting up Python 

If you are on macOS or Linux, chances are that you already have Python installed. You can open terminal, and type `python --version` or `python3 --version`. In this tutorial, we will use Python 3. 

If Python 3 is not installed in your machine, you can either go to official python website <https://www.python.org> 

Another, alternative way is to install Anaconda - <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/> This will install Python, along with other useful packages. Some packages, you might not even need. So while this is very handy, the installation will require more disk space. 

Final option is to use an online service. You can use Google Colab - <https://colab.research.google.com> or Microsoft Azure Notebook - <http://notebooks.azure.com> Both services require sign up, either a Google of Microsoft account depending on which service you choose. 

We will follow our learning using a Notebook. If you have your setup ready in a local machine, please install Jupyter Notebook. If you are using Anaconda, it is already there (Launch Anaconda Navigator > Jupyter Notebook). You can install issuing `pip install jupyter-notebook` or `pip3 install jupyter-notebook` You can launch, by typing `jupyter-notebook` in the Terminal. If you are on Windows, and Anaconda installed, you may use Conda prompt. If you run into trouble, please do a online research, there are plenty of resources around to get you going. 

You can download all the Notebooks used for this tutorial from my GitHub page <https://github.com/pranabdas/python-learning>
