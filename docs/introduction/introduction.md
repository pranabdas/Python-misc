### Introduction 

Python is an high level interpreted programming language. Unlike C, C++, you don't need to compile the code first to generate a binary, and then run the binary to get the result. Python returns results as soon as the commands/scripts are executed. 

The syntax is quite intuitive (more human readable than other popular languages). If you have some familiarity with MATLAB, you will find yourself at home. 

Good thing about Python is everything is open source. You will find libraries/packages for most tasks already written by someone. However, Python is not good for everything. While it is easier to implement a functioning program quickly, it is slower compared to C/C++/Go etc.
